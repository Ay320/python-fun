This repositry contains python projects that I have worked on in my free time for fun and learning.

# file 1 : ticket sales
This Python project simulates a theater's ticket sales for two seating categories (Band A and Band B) and calculates the revenue generated from a **Full House** and a **Part House** seating arrangement. The program also computes the break-even point for both seating arrangements and provides detailed row-by-row analysis for the Part House.
- Full house : all tickets are sold.
- Part house : randomly generated.
# file 2 : BlackJack
This is a simple command-line Blackjack game implemented in Python. The game follows the standard Blackjack rules where the user plays against the computer (dealer). 
The goal is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.
## How to play:
1. Both the player and the computer are dealt two cards initially (only one of the computer’s cards is shown).
2. The player can choose to either "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (end their turn).
3. The game will automatically replace an Ace (11) with a value of 1 if the total goes over 21.
4. The computer will continue drawing cards until its score is at least 17.
5. The player wins if:
   - They get exactly 21 (Blackjack).
   - Their score is higher than the computer’s without going over 21.
   - The computer’s total exceeds 21.
6. The player loses if:
   - Their total exceeds 21.
   - The computer's score is higher without going over 21.
