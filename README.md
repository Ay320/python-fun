# file 1 : ticket sales
This Python project simulates a theater's ticket sales for two seating categories (Band A and Band B) and calculates the revenue generated from a **Full House** and a **Part House** seating arrangement. The program also computes the break-even point for both seating arrangements and provides detailed row-by-row analysis for the Part House.
- Full house : all tickets are sold.
- Part house : randomly generated.
